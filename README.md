## About

Metacognition Quest is a 10-15 minute text adventure with an 80s terminal aesthetic. Players navigate scenarios where an AI companion is available to help, and between chapters, "Socrates" poses reflective questions based on the player's actual decisions.

The game teaches metacognition—thinking about one's own thinking—by making players examine their choices and patterns.

## Features

- Three narrative scenarios with branching choices
- AI companion available via `ASK [question]` command
- Socratic reflection pauses with personalized questions
- Decision tracking and pattern analysis
- Retro terminal aesthetic (green text on black)

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Type commands and press ENTER to make choices
3. Use `ASK [question]` anytime to consult your AI companion
4. Reflect on Socrates' questions between chapters
